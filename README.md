# 📝 Todo App

A simple and modern **Todo Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring a clean **black UI**. This app helps users manage daily tasks efficiently with an intuitive and visually pleasing dark-mode interface.

Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks with ease. Completed tasks are visually distinguished using subtle styling to improve clarity and focus. The application emphasizes minimalism, smooth interactions, and a distraction-free experience.

This project demonstrates core front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive UI design. It is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and serves as a strong foundation for extending features like local storage, task editing, or theme toggling.
